The site features a landfill that takes up approximately 35% of the acreage and rises to about 4 stories in height. 71 acres of the property is zoned for low-density residential use, and the other 4 acres are zoned for general industrial use.

Maple Meadows is bordered on the west by a predominantly residential part of Wilmington and on the east by an industrial hub that is concentrated around Interstate-93. This industrial hub is one of the preeminent last-mile delivery locations in Massachusetts, as it resides at the junction of I-93 and I-95; it is comprised of over 7.5 million SF of industrial space. Some of the notable industrial/warehouse tenants are Crate & Barrel, Pepsi, FedEx Ground, and Keystone Automotive. Nearby employers and retailers include Raytheon, American Tower Corporation, Target, Boston Sports Club, Starbucks, and Chipotle. The Wilmington/Woburn town line sits about a quarter-mile to the south of the site. Maple Meadows itself is about two and a half miles from the nearest exit/entrance to I-93.

Maple Meadows offers investors a myriad of opportunities to create value on a vast swathe of land. There are very few unimproved sites of this size within 10 miles of downtown Boston left. While much of the site is use-restricted by the landfill and by wetlands, there is still substantial acreage that is potentially developable into industrial and/or residential uses.

Located in the center of Union Square, the heart of Somerville’s new zoning initiative is an assemblage of 6 lots between three owners (“Owners” or “Ownership”) who have asked Boston Realty Advisors to exclusively market their land together. 273 Somerville Ave Ownership shares the block that lies between Somerville Avenue, Washington Street and Merriam Street with the City of Somerville. The Site is entirely located within an Opportunity Zone.

As of December 12th 2019, the City of Somerville passed a comprehensive, city wide zoning overhaul in hopes to maximize demand by transforming Union Square into a mixed-use hub. With the delivery of the future Union Square MBTA Green Line station, the new zoning code calls for the urbanization of Union Square increasing employment opportunities in the City of Somerville. 273 Somerville Ave, based on the new zoning code, is in the Commercial Core 5 district with a Master Plan Development Overlay implemented to create design-based neighborhood and station area plans.
